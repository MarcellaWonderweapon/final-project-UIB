# üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The healthy Web Developer

**Technologies used**: HTML, CSS <br>
**Objective**: Creating a landing page for developers, who desire to improve their health, happiness and wellbeing

## Welcome to ‚ÄúThe Healthy Web Developer‚Äù!

This is my final project for the module ‚ÄúUser Interface Basics‚Äù at DCI, my school for Web Development, where I am currently studying. We were free to choose our own topic. So I decided to create a Landing Page for Web Developers, who wish to gain a more healthy and happy lifestyle.

We all know, that our life as developers can be quite stressful sometimes. We spend lots of time sitting in front of our computers. In fact, we are the perfect example of a modern sedentary professional lifestyle. When we take part in a Hackathon - and for some of us, not only then - pizza might turn into our main source of nutrition.

The inspiration for the landing page was that of an online community and online school for web developers, who wish to improve their quality of lifestyle. The goal of the page is to encourage them to try it for free. Later this free trial might turn into a paid membership.

As this project is 100% HTML and CSS, please don‚Äôt try the contact form - it doesn‚Äôt work. Also, the community and online school don‚Äôt exist. Maybe one day in the future! ;-)

Since I am a native German, you might wonder: Why is her English so stylish and polished? I‚Äôm glad you ask üòâ Well, this is because of Jade, my fabulous English teacher at Lingoda language school, who helped me to work it all out. A big Thank You for that! Language lessons are part of the DCI schedule - that‚Äôs pretty awesome, in my opinion.

Creating this project was fun. Although I am not a designer, I enjoy the design element of a project almost as much as coding. Fun fact: people praise, how I matched the color of the woman‚Äôs bra with the font's color. It is my belief, that those little details make all the difference.

If you have a Figma Account, you can check out how I came up with the design at https://www.figma.com/file/AlkH04WITZHye1YOHpHSth/Healthy-Webdeveloper?node-id=0%3A1 . If you don‚Äôt have a Figma Account, you can at least look at some screenshots in images > about.

What still needs to be done?
You might notice, that responsiveness and a good User Experience matter a lot to me. A quick check at Chrome‚Äôs Lighthouse shows, that Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO all score 90% or more for the desktop - although not quite the 100% I aspire to - I suppose, it is not too bad!

Accessibility is particularly close to my heart. At the moment, the ‚ÄúTry now for free‚Äù button is causing me some issues - the color ratio between the font and background is not sufficient, making it hard to read for people with color blindness / impaired vision. I have already darkened the background color and worked with text shadow, but this is still not enough. I will continue to develop my skills to solve this.

When it comes to mobile devices, all scores are at least 92%. For now, I am happy with the result. Still, I really would like to learn more about improving all those fields in the future. I believe, that users deserve the very best experience!

And let‚Äôs face it - the gamification approach of Chrome‚Äôs Lighthouse appeals to the gamer in us! We all want to get the 100%! (Or is it just me‚Ä¶?) This being said, one thing really bothers me. On my mobile phone, the ‚ÄúTry now for free‚Äù button the padding disappeared for no apparent reason. I really need to figure out, why this is happening. Let me know if you know why!
